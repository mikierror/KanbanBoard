## 🚀 Overview

The **React Kanban Task Manager** is a minimal and clean Kanban board where users can:

- ➕ Add tasks to different boards (To Do, On Going, Finished)
- ✏️ Edit tasks in-line
- 🖱️ Drag and drop tasks between boards
- 🗑️ Remove tasks (future feature – not implemented yet)

This application demonstrates key concepts like state management, conditional rendering, and drag-and-drop behavior in React.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- 🧠 useState (for managing local board/task states)
- 🖱️ Drag-and-drop logic (via HTML5 API)
